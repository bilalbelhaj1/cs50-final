## Description
The Wild World is a web app that introduces wildlife and shares knowledge about the wild. Users can generate different fun facts about wildlife, and the app provides free resources to learn about various animals. Users can also create accounts, log in, and log out on the website.

I chose to make this project because I have always been fascinated by wildlife. Since I was a kid, I loved watching documentaries about nature and animals. So, when given the opportunity to build a web app, I wanted to create something I loveâ€”something that allows people to gain knowledge and explore the amazing creatures that rule the wild.

## Features
The Wild World website includes the following features:
- Users can create accounts, log in, and log out.
- The home page introduces The Wild World with a welcoming hero section and a section featuring different animals to learn about.
- Users can generate fun facts about wildlife.
- A section answers the most frequently asked questions about the wild world.
- Users can search for any animal in the search bar and get detailed information, including:
  - General information about the animal.
  - Description, behavior, origin, eating habits, etc.
  - A gallery of fun images related to that animal.
  - Fun facts about the animal.
